CREATE POLICY "Allow all for authenticated users" ON polling_units FOR ALL USING (true);
```

## Refresh Intervals

- **Dashboard Stats:** Every 60 seconds
- **Latest Results Feed:** Every 30 seconds

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify stats cards show correct data
- [ ] Check that "PU Agents Profiled" shows profiled vs expected
- [ ] Confirm "Results Submitted" shows submitted vs expected
- [ ] Validate "Incidents" shows investigating vs resolved counts
- [ ] Test live results feed displays correctly
- [ ] Verify auto-refresh works for both stats and feed
- [ ] Check responsive layout on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Ensure party colors are consistent across all views
- [ ] Test with empty data (no results yet)
- [ ] Verify timestamps display correctly in local time

## Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to other components
- Uses existing database schema (polling_units table)
- Maintains consistent styling with current dashboard
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
