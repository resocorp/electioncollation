# Scale Fixes - Complete Implementation Package
**6000 Agents Across 6 GoIP Lines - Production Ready**

---

## 📦 What's Included

This package contains all fixes, documentation, and tools needed to deploy the election collation system at scale.

### 🔧 Core Fixes Implemented

1. **Session-Based Line Affinity** - Agents receive replies from the same number
2. **Duplicate Prevention** - Agents cannot submit results twice
3. **Database Optimization** - Indexes and constraints for high concurrency
4. **Message Ordering** - Handles out-of-order webhooks gracefully
5. **Automatic Failover** - Responses delivered even if preferred line fails
6. **Health Monitoring** - Real-time system status and alerting

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard (easiest)
1. Go to https://ncftsabdnuwemcqnlzmr.supabase.co
2. SQL Editor → Open file: supabase/migrations/004_line_affinity_and_optimizations.sql
3. Run the SQL

# Or via command line
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/004_line_affinity_and_optimizations.sql
```

### Step 2: Configure Connection Pool (2 minutes)
```
Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database → Connection Pooling
- Mode: Transaction
- Pool Size: 50-100
```

### Step 3: Restart Application (1 minute)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Run Tests (5 minutes)
```bash
node scripts/test-line-affinity.js
node scripts/test-duplicate-prevention.js
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sms/health
```

### Step 5: Verify (2 minutes)
```sql
-- Check indexes created
SELECT tablename, indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('election_results', 'sms_sessions');

-- Check constraint exists
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conname = 'unique_agent_pu_result';
```

**Total time: ~15 minutes**

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before Fixes
❌ Agents confused by replies from different numbers  
❌ Duplicate results possible  
❌ Database not optimized for 12,000 ops  
❌ Out-of-order messages caused confusion  
❌ No failover when line goes down  
❌ No system health monitoring  

### After Fixes
✅ Agents get replies from same number they contacted  
✅ Duplicates prevented (DB constraint + app logic)  
✅ Database optimized with 5 new indexes  
✅ Graceful handling of message ordering issues  
✅ Automatic failover to available lines  
✅ Real-time health monitoring endpoint

## 🧪 Testing Tools

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Test line affinity
node scripts/test-line-affinity.js

# Test duplicate prevention
node scripts/test-duplicate-prevention.js

# Test health monitoring
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sms/health | jq '.'
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Simulate incoming SMS
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sms/goip/incoming \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "goip_line": "goip-10101",
    "from_number": "08012345678",
    "content": "R APGA:450 APC:320",
    "recv_time": "2025-10-26T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Install artillery
npm install -g artillery

# Run load test (10 req/sec for 60 seconds)
artillery quick --count 10 --num 600 \
  http://localhost:3000/api/sms/goip/incoming
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sms/health

# Returns:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "summary": {
    "lines_available": 6,
    "error_rate": "2.3%",
    "active_users": 247
  }
}
```

### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Linux/Mac - Run every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /path/to/scripts/run-health-check.sh

# Windows - Use Task Scheduler
powershell.exe -File "C:\path\to\scripts\run-health-check.ps1"
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Lines Available**: Should be 6/6 (or close)
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 5%
- **Webhook Activity**: Should be > 0 during peak hours
- **Active Sessions**: Variable (depends on traffic)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ Capacity Limitation
**Your 6 lines can handle 60-90 SMS/min**  
**Peak load will be 600 SMS/min**  
**You need to either:**

1. **Add 34 more lines** (40 total) - Expensive
2. **Batch submissions by LGA** (recommended) - Free
3. **Use SMS gateway for responses** - Hybrid approach

**Recommended**: Batch by LGA
- 21 LGAs × 5-minute slots = 1h 45min
- Brings load to ~57 SMS/min ✓

### ⚠️ Webhook Reliability
DBL SMS Server does NOT store messages. If your server is down when webhook is sent, **message is lost**.

**Prevention**:
- Use reliable hosting (99.9% uptime)
- Monitor health endpoint continuously
- Have manual backup plan

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Agent not found"**
```sql
-- Create test agents
INSERT INTO agents (phone_number, name, polling_unit_code, ward, lga, role)
VALUES ('08012345678', 'Test Agent', 'TEST-PU-001', 'Test Ward', 'Test LGA', 'pu_agent');
```

**2. "Cannot connect to DBL SMS Server"**
```bash
# Check connectivity
ping 159.65.59.78
curl http://159.65.59.78

# Verify .env.local
grep DBL_SMS .env.local
```

**3. "Duplicate not prevented"**
```sql
-- Check constraint exists
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conname = 'unique_agent_pu_result';

-- Should return 1 row
```

**4. "Health check fails"**
```bash
# Check if dev server is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check logs
npm run dev
# Look for errors
```
