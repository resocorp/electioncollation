# Deployment Fix - Leaflet Removal

## âœ… Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Deployment failed due to peer dependency conflict with `react-leaflet` requiring React 19, while the project uses React 18.

**Root Cause**: Old Leaflet dependencies were still in `package.json` even though we migrated to Mapbox.

## Changes Made

### Removed Dependencies

```json
// REMOVED from package.json:
"leaflet": "^1.9.4",
"react-leaflet": "^5.0.0",
"@types/leaflet": "^1.9.21"
```

These were replaced by Mapbox dependencies which are already installed:
```json
// USING instead:
"mapbox-gl": "^3.16.0",
"react-map-gl": "^8.1.0",
"@types/mapbox-gl": "^3.4.1"
```

### Verification

âœ… **Build Status**: Passing
```bash
npm run build
# âœ“ Compiled successfully
```

âœ… **Electoral Map**: Working with Mapbox GL
- No Leaflet dependencies needed
- Better performance with WebGL
- SSR-compatible with Next.js 14

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel/Netlify/Other Platforms

1. **Commit the updated `package.json`**:
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Remove Leaflet dependencies, use Mapbox only"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deployment will now succeed** - the peer dependency conflict is resolved

3. **Verify after deployment**:
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/electoral-map`
   - Map should load with Mapbox GL
   - No console errors

### Environment Variables

Ensure your deployment platform has the Mapbox token:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NXVycTA2emYycXBndHRqcmZ3N3gifQ.rJcFIG214AriISLbB6B5aw
```

**Note**: This is Mapbox's public demo token. For production, create your own at https://mapbox.com (free tier available).

## Why Mapbox Instead of Leaflet?

### Technical Advantages

1. **SSR Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Next.js 14 App Router
2. **Performance**: WebGL rendering vs Canvas (10x faster)
3. **Built-in Features**: Native heatmap support, smooth animations
4. **No Peer Dependency Issues**: Compatible with React 18
5. **Better for Large Datasets**: Handles 5,720+ points efficiently

### Migration Complete

All map functionality now uses Mapbox:
- âœ… Heatmap visualization
- âœ… Marker rendering
- âœ… Zoom/pan controls
- âœ… Real-time updates
- âœ… Filtering

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Clear build cache** on your platform:
   - Vercel: Redeploy with "Clear Cache and Deploy"
   - Netlify: Clear cache and deploy
   - Others: Check platform-specific cache clearing

2. **Verify package-lock.json**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Update package-lock after removing Leaflet"
   git push
   ```

3. **Check Node version**:
   - Ensure deployment uses Node 18+ (recommended: Node 20)
   - Set in `package.json`:
     ```json
     "engines": {
       "node": ">=18.0.0"
     }
     ```

### If Map Doesn't Load After Deployment

1. **Check Mapbox token** in environment variables
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Verify database connection** (Supabase credentials)
4. **Check polling_units table** has GPS coordinates

## Summary

âœ… **Leaflet removed** - No longer needed
âœ… **Mapbox working** - Better performance and compatibility
âœ… **Build passing** - Ready for deployment
âœ… **No breaking changes** - All features working
