## âœ… Phase 1: Database Preparation

### Database Migration
- [ ] Migration `004_line_affinity_and_optimizations.sql` applied
- [ ] All 6 indexes created and verified
- [ ] Unique constraint `unique_agent_pu_result` exists
- [ ] Helper views created: `line_usage_stats`, `active_sms_sessions`
- [ ] Cleanup function `cleanup_old_sms_sessions()` exists

**Verification Commands**:
```sql
-- Check indexes
SELECT tablename, indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('election_results', 'sms_sessions', 'sms_logs')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- Should show 5+ new indexes

-- Check constraint
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'election_results'::regclass 
  AND conname = 'unique_agent_pu_result';
-- Should return 1 row

-- Check views
SELECT viewname FROM pg_views WHERE viewname IN ('line_usage_stats', 'active_sms_sessions');
-- Should return 2 rows
```

### Connection Pooling
- [ ] Supabase pool mode set to: **Transaction**
- [ ] Pool size configured: **50-100 connections**
- [ ] Tested under load: Connection count < 50% of pool size

**Settings Location**: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Database â†’ Connection Pooling

### Data Loading

- [ ] Phone numbers in correct format: `08XXXXXXXXX` (11 digits, starting with 0)
- [ ] Each agent has valid `polling_unit_code`, `ward`, `lga`
- [ ] No duplicate phone numbers

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check agent count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE role = 'pu_agent';
-- Should return: 6000

-- Check phone format
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents 
WHERE phone_number !~ '^0[0-9]{10}$' OR LENGTH(phone_number) != 11;
-- Should return: 0

-- Check for duplicates
SELECT phone_number, COUNT(*) 
FROM agents 
GROUP BY phone_number 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Should return: 0 rows
```

## âœ… Phase 6: Capacity Planning

### Current Setup Review
Number of GoIP lines: _______ (minimum recommended: 6)

  - Status: _______

- [ ] **Option B**: Batch submissions by LGA (recommended)
